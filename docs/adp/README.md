# Architecture Decision Proposals (ADP)

This folder contains **Architecture Decision Proposals** for `llm_dart`.

Why ADPs:

- Capture *why* we made a decision (context + constraints), not just *what* we built.
- Reduce “refactor drift” during fearless refactors by keeping a stable target.
- Make it easier for contributors to understand design trade-offs.

Conventions:

- File name: `NNNN-short-title.md`
- Sections: Context → Problem → Decision → Consequences → Migration plan → Open questions
- Keep docs in **English**; discuss in Chinese in issues/PRs.
