## üí° Key Concepts

### Reasoning Models
- **Thinking Process**: Access to AI's internal reasoning
- **Complex Problems**: Better performance on multi-step tasks
- **Chain of Thought**: Step-by-step problem solving
- **Verification**: Self-checking and validation

### Multi-modal Processing
- **Vision**: Image analysis and understanding
- **Audio**: Speech processing and generation
- **Documents**: PDF, text, and file processing
- **Integration**: Combining different modalities

### Custom Providers
- **Interfaces**: Implementing ChatCapability
- **Flexibility**: Custom behavior and features
- **Integration**: Seamless library integration
- **Testing**: Mock providers for development

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Response and computation caching
- **Batching**: Efficient request grouping
- **Streaming**: Real-time processing
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and optimization

## üìñ Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced features, ensure you've completed:

1. **[Getting Started](../01_getting_started/)** - Basic setup
2. **[Core Features](../02_core_features/)** - Essential functionality
3. **Basic understanding of async/await patterns**
4. **Familiarity with Dart interfaces and classes**

## üîó Related Examples

- **Core**: [Streaming Chat](../02_core_features/streaming_chat.dart) - Foundation for advanced streaming
- **Use Cases**: [Voice Assistant](../05_use_cases/voice_assistant.dart) - Multi-modal application
- **Integration**: [Flutter App](../06_integration/flutter_app.dart) - Production integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### API Requirements
- **Reasoning models** require specific model access (e.g., OpenAI o1 series)
- **Multi-modal features** may require additional API permissions
- **Audio processing** requires ElevenLabs API for some features

### Performance Considerations
- **Reasoning models** are slower but more accurate
- **Multi-modal processing** requires more bandwidth
- **Custom providers** should implement proper error handling
- **Optimization techniques** may increase complexity

### Cost Implications
- **Reasoning models** typically cost more per token
- **Multi-modal processing** has additional costs for images/audio
- **Performance optimization** can reduce overall costs
