# llm_dart_provider_utils

Shared HTTP and provider utilities for `llm_dart` provider packages.

This package centralizes common functionality (Dio configuration, response handling, SSE parsing, error mapping) so provider implementations stay focused on provider-specific request/response logic.

## Installation

```bash
dart pub add llm_dart_provider_utils
```

## Usage

Most users do not need to import this package directly. It is intended for provider package authors and advanced integrations.
