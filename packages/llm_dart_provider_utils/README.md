# llm_dart_provider_utils

Shared HTTP/SSE/tooling utilities for `llm_dart` providers and protocol reuse packages.

This is primarily a dependency for:

- provider packages (e.g. `llm_dart_openai`, `llm_dart_anthropic`)
- protocol reuse packages (e.g. `llm_dart_openai_compatible`, `llm_dart_anthropic_compatible`)

Most applications should not need to depend on this package directly.
